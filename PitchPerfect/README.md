#  Summary
This application was created specifically for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. This app allows users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader.This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

# Technologies Used In Application:
AVFoundation,
Stack Views,
Auto Layout,
UIKit,
Swift

# User Interface
Pitch Perfect has two main view controllers:
RecordSoundsViewController : This controller contains two buttons. Tapping the record button start the recording and tapping on the stop recording button will stop the recording and transition into PlaySoundsViewController.

PlaySoundsViewController : This controller contains six buttons, tapping on each of them will playback the recorded audio in a different effect.

The application uses code from AVFoundation to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine).

# Closing:
In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project.
I am confident that I mastered AVFoundation and am able to successfully create applications using different scenes .I also leveraged the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView.
